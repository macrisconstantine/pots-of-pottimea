# pots-of-pottimea
This is my favorite project that I've made.
## Description
- Small RPG heavily inspired by the Zelda series.
- Developed in C# in Unity.
## Instructions to run
- Download all files (script source files are not necessary).
- Ensure all files and directories are in a common directory.
- Run the main ```.exe``` file.
## Important note
- If you download the repo files via the "Download Zip" button, some resource files (4 .resS files) will not download properly, since they make use of the Git LFS system.
- Cloning the repo via Git will download all resource files properly.
- Another solution is to download the four .resS files individually, and add them into the "TheSmasherOfPots_Data" directory.
